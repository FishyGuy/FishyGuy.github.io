This week, we went over how to fix problems and that it is important to go through what you have done or what you need to do step by step. We went over the importances of libraries and how the RAM opens things from the hard drive which contain the libraries. We also discussed how computers only answer in YES or NO. If a computer is asked if a yellow duck is "yellow or blue", the computer will say yes as it is yellow. It will also say yes if it was blue but not any other colour.
