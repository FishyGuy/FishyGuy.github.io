In this lesson, we used python code to draw basic shaped/letters. We use code to command the turtle in a way that it draws a line behind it and make a shape.

This is my code that makes a 3D letter "L". The numbers next to the turtle.left/right are the angles at which the turtle will turn. The numbers next to the turtle.forward.backward are how many units it will move in that direction. The “def draw_L():” creates the function “draw_L()” which when called with “draw_L()” runs the function. For the maths of working out all the lengths and angles, I used this beautiful thing called “Trial and Error”.
