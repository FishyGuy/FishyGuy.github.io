    <td>I then worked out how much profit I would make a year if my sales continued like they had. I had my profit from the main shop, minus the cost of employees, minus 19% of my profit for tax. I then set it so that if the number is below 50,000, colour the box yellowy orange, and if it was below 30,000, colour the box red.
