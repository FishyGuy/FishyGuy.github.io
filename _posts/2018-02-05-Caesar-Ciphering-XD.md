In IT, we have closed down our Tescos Express and now we are moving on to becoming spies for the Koala Klub Military. We have structured code in a way that when a letter, word or phrase is entered into a series of corresponding boxes, the next box displays the encoded version.

This is what my letters will become in my version of the code. It is completely original and unique.

My code displays this. I am able to change the "What it would be" to whatever I want and the Encoded Text will change as well. The Code box is just “Concatenate”.
