I start working on the pyg latin translator and make it so that if the user enters an invalid word, it will say "empty". If they enter an actual word, it will reply with the word you entered.

Using the translator: I made the variable "ay". I then make it so the code says what i've typed back and make a variable called “first” that holds the first letter of the word.

To finish the translator, I make it so that the word it prints is the original word entered plus the first letter of it plus "ay".
