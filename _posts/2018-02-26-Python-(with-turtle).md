The "for number in range" is a repeat for the lines after with a white space. “Import turtle” just means my code has grabbed the data from “turtle” and I can use it now for the rest of the code.

I have replaced the numbers with variables to make it so I can easily change the shape I want to make. The code "360/sides" is the formula to make a regular shape's inner angles.

The "while True" code makes it so that any code assigned to it will continue on forever. The “14” is how many sides the shape has and the “25” is how large the shape will be. The “13” will decide the angle.
